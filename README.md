# <b>Frontend project skeletons</b>

## Hello there, I made this repository because I end up wasting quite some time on initialising projects. After using something like vite / create-react-app /create-next-app, I end up having to clean up some of the code and adding basic boilerplate stuff. The purpose of this repo is to reduce the amount of time it takes to set up projects and to reduce errors caused by typos,etc. I will keep on adding skeletons as and when I use them.

## To use any of the react skeletons

```
git clone https://github.com/viraj-s15/frontend-skeletons.git
cd frontend-skeletons
cd vite-react-<css framework>
yarn
yarn run dev
```

## To use any of the next skeletons

```
git clone https://github.com/viraj-s15/frontend-skeletons.git
cd frontend-skeletons
cd next-<css framework>
yarn
yarn run dev
```
